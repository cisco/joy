/** \remarks \verbatim
   flow_records can be accessed in either of two ways: 
  
     - An individual record can be looked up by its flow key, which
       uses the flow_record_list_array[], which is indexed by the
       flow_key_hash() function; this is a doubly linked list.
  
     - All records can be listed in chronological order, using the
       time_next pointer's linked list.  (That list will actually be
       ordered based on when each flow record is allocated and
       initialized, which in most cases is the order in which new
       flows are observed.)  The head and tail of that list are
       flow_record_chrono_first and flow_record_chrono_last,
       respectively.
  
   Flows are allocated and initialized by the flow_key_get_record()
   function when the CREATE_RECORDS flag is set in the arguments to
   that function.  
  
   Each flow_record describes a single unidirectional flow.  The twin
   pointer contains the address to the flow record of the twin (that
   is, the flow with source and destination addresses and ports
   reversed), if there is a twin; otherwise, the twin pointer is NULL.
   The twin pointer is set in flow_key_get_record(), and that function
   adds a newly created flow_record to the chronological list only if
   it has no twin.
  
   The function flow_record_list_free() frees *all* flow records in
   the flow_record_list_array[].  This function should only be used
   after all processing of all of the associated flows is done.

/**
 * \brief The function flow_key_get_record(k, flag) returns a pointer to a
 * flow_record structure that has flow_key k.  If such a record
 * existed before the invocation, then it returns a pointer to that
 * record.  If no matching flow_record exists before invocation, then
 * if flag=CREATE_RECORDS, a flow_record will be allocated and
 * initialized, but if flag=DONT_CREATE_RECORDS, then a NULL pointer
 * will be returned.  If flag=CREATE_RECORDS, a NULL pointer will be
 * returned if the malloc() call that attempts to allocate memory for
 * a new flow_record structure itself returns NULL.
 *
 * \brief If the pointer returned by flow_key_get_record() is not NULL, then
 * it points to a flow_record structure that is fully initialized (if
 * it is newly created) and potentially already populated with some
 * flow data (if not newly created).  
 * 
 * \brief The twin of a flow_key (src, dst, srcp, dstp, pr) is the flow_key
 * (dst, src, dstp, srcp, pr) with addresses and ports swapped.  If a
 * flow_record that is the twin of the flow_key k exists before the
 * invocation of flow_key_get_records(k, flag), then the pointer
 * "flow_record_t *twin" of both that record and its twin are set
 * to point to each other.  That is, this function performs the
 * stitching of unidirectional flows into bidirectional flows as
 * appropriate.  The function flow_record_print_json() recognizes when
 * a flow_record is part of a bidirectional flow by checking the
 * "twin" pointer, and prints out bidirectional information.
