 *
 * \brief joy internal interface for data feature modules
 *
 * \remarks
 * \verbatim
 * Overview: this interface provides a way to implement a new feature
 * (that is, a new network data feature that will be captured and
 * reported on by the Joy package) without altering any of the core
 * files of the joy program.  This extensibility is achieved by
 * using preprocessor macros in a generic programming style, using the
 * MAP() define from map.h.  In essence, there are macros inside
 * joy that provide hooks that will define the feature and call
 * the functions at the appropriate time; by adding a feature to the
 * feature_list, it is hooked into the system without any need to
 * modify any of the core joy source code files.
 *
 *  A new feature with the name of "F" * is added by:
 * 
 *   1) defining a structure named "F" that holds all of the data
 *      context for that feature, for a single unidirecitonal flow,
 *      and a typedef defining F_t to be equivalent to "struct F", in
 *      a separate C header file (preferably one named F.h),
 * 
 *   2) implenting functions that match the function declarations made
 *      by the declare_feature(F) macro below, in a separate C file
 *      (preferably one named F.c),
 * 
 *   3) define the macro F_usage to be a constant, printable C string
 *      that describes the usage of the feature, in the header file,
 *
 *   4) define the macro F_filter(key), in the header file, to be a C
 *      expression that operates on the struct flow_key (in p2f.h) and
 *      evaluates to true for flows on which the data feature should
 *      be collecting information, 
 *
 *   5) add the C header file to the files included in modules.h, and
 *
 *   6) add F to the comma-separated list, in the #define for
 *   feature_list below.
 *
 * The files example.c and example.h provide a simple example of a
 * (trivial) feature module.  The dns.c and dns.h files provide a
 * slightly more complex example of a non-trivial module; the macro
 * dns_filter() provides a good example of how a feature can filter on
 * protocols and ports.
 *
 * This interface has been designed to provide extensibility and
 * modularity, and it achieves these goals reasonably well.  It may be
 * altered in the future to improve performance and/or ease of use.
 * 
 * NOTE: the only configuration option supported so far is a boolean;
 * other types may need to be supported in the future.
