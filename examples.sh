# examples for running the sleuth program 

# quick documentation for sleuth
#
# The sleuth program reads a stream of flow objects, processes each one
# in sequence, and writes out the resulting objects.  There are several
# processing stages, each of which is optional; their order is:
#
#    Filtering objects (--where)
#    Selecting elements (--select)
#    Splitting into multiple output streams (--split)
#    Computing the distribution (--dist)
#    Computing the sum of particular elements (--sum)
#
# The --pretty command causes the JSON output to be pretty-printted,
# in which case there is a single JSON element on each line, with
# indentation to promote readability.
#
#
# The --stitch command causes flow objects to be stitched together;
# this option SHOULD always be used with flow data; otherwise, a
# single long-lived flow might appear to be a succession of flows, and
# this situation creates ambiguity about flow direction.
# 
#
# The --select command selects particular elements to be included in
# the objects; all other elements are excluded.  The order of the
# objects is unchanged.  The syntax is:
#
# --select <elementlist>
# 
#   <elementlist> = <element>
#                   OR <elementlist> , <element>
# 
#   <element> = pseudo-JSON expresson, like "ob" or "packets[{b}]" or
#               "ohttp{Content-Encoding}"
# 
#
#
# The --where command filters objects against a condition, so that the
# condition is true for each object output.  The order of the objects
# is unchanged.  The syntax is:
#
# --where <condition>
# 
#   <condition> = <predicate> 
#                 OR '(' <predicate> ')' 
#                 OR <predicate> '|' <predicate>   # or (disjuntion)
#      	          OR <predicate> ',' <predicate>   # and (conjunction)
#  
#   <predicate> = <element> <operator> <value>
# 
#   <operator>  = '='       # equals 
#                 OR '~'    # not equals
#                 OR '>'    # greater than (numbers only)
#                 OR '<'    # less than (numbers only)
# 
#   <value>     = <characterstring> 
#                 OR <number>
# 
#   <element>   = as above 
#
# The condition <element>=* is true whenever <element> is present in
# an object, and <element>~* is true whenever <element> is not present
# in an object.  The 'wildcard' values '*' and '?' can be included in
# character strings (one or more times), in which case '*' matches any
# sequence of characters and '?' matches any single character.  If
# <element> is an array, then its predicate is true if it holds for
# any value in the array.
#
#
# The command --dist computes the distribution of the objects, and
# counts the number of times that each object appears in the stream,
# as well as the total number of objects; elements representing those
# sums are included in the output stream as "count" and "total",
# respectively.  The order of the objects may be changed.  The --dist
# command does not have any arguments.
#
# The --dist command is currently a memory hog, and it might fail on
# very large data inputs.
# 
#
# The --split command splits the input stream into one or more output
# streams, indexed by one or more elements.  The output order of the
# objects may be different than the input order.  The syntax is:
#
# --split <elementlist> 
#
# For each value of the elements in <elementlist>, a separate output
# stream is created.  The downstream processing is performed
# separately on each of those output streams.  For instance: 
#
#  '--split da' creates a separate stream for each destination address
#
#  '--split da,dp' creates a stream for each distinct (destination
#  address, destination port) tuple
#
# The --split command is currently a memory hog, and it might fail on
# very large data inputs.
#
#
# The command --sum computes the sum, across all objects, of one or more
# elements.  The order of the objects may be changed.  The syntax is:
#
# --sum <elementlist> 
#
# For each <element> in the argument, the value of that element from
# each object in the stream is added into a tally, which is written
# into an output object as the value of that element.  The <elements>
# list must contain at least one element, and may contain multiple
# elements.  The other elements in the object SHOULD be constant.
# 
#
